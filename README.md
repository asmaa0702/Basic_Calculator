### **Explaining the variables were used:**

#### *``a``* & *``b``* : my main variables of my little basic calc
#### *``sign``* : it's the signs I'll use for math.
#### *``x``* : the variable I'll use to get the result of my algo in
#### *``dis``* : It's the String which displayed on the screen
#### *``Adot``* & *``Bdot``* : bools to make sure if my main variables have ``.`` or not. to not repeat it on the screen
#### *``last``* : I was confused. how will I save *``b``* ! and I used this variable to save numbers after ``sign`` to make my *``b``*
